1. Make sure django is installed on your computer ("pip install django")
2. Navigate to the file on your computer that you want to make the project in ("cd [path]")
3. Start the Django project ("django-admin startproject [projectname]")
    - When you open up the created folder, there will be another folder with your project name. This is the core app of the project
4. Then navigate into the project folder ("cd [projectname]")

How do urls.py and views.py work?
1. The browser makes a request to a url (ex: /about)
2. The urls.py file receives and reads the requested url
3. After reading this url, it decides which function to fire in views.py
4. Once the view is determined, the views.py file sends the response to the browser
