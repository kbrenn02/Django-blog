# Dear Diary: A Django-blog
An example of my experience setting up a web application using Django. In this case, I opted to go with a blog as it has several components, including: articles (which can be written by any user once logged in), user sign up, user authentication, and protected pages.

### Technologies Used
Django

### Requirements
Dear Diary requires Python (or Python 3 for Mac). To download, please follow this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Run the Program
To run the Dear Diary program on your local device:
1. Clone the github repo to your IDE (I personally use VSCode)
2. In the terminal, run `python manage.py runserver`
This should open up the application, likely on port 127.0.0.1:8000, unless this port is already in use

### Usage Instructions
Once you have the applicaiton running on your local device, signup up for an account.
After your account is created, you will be able to add articles for everyone to read (please only post appropraite content)
